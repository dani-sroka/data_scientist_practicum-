# Data
- index: time
- num_orders: number of orders

# Goal:
Using time series data on taxi orders at airports to create a model that predicts the amount of taxi orders for any given time frame, by:
- Analysis of the trends and seasonality of time series
- Engeneer analysis-based features from time series, to optimize prediction accuracy
- Use obtained features to train a regression model

# Libraries
*pandas, numpy, matplotlib, statsmodels, sklearn, lightgbm, *
