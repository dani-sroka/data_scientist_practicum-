# Data
3 tables of sorted data about Chicago taxi rides, that were analysed and created using SQL at a preliminary stage:

## Companies
- the number of rides for each taxi company on November 15-16, 2017 (64 entries).

## Neighborhoods
- the average number of rides that ended in each neighborhood in November 2017 (94 entries).
