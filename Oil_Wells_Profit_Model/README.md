# Data

- id — unique oil well identifier
- f0, f1, f2 — three features of points (their specific meaning is unimportant, but the features themselves are significant)
- product — volume of reserves in the oil well (thousand barrels)

# Goal
Analyzing data from several petroleum reservoir regions and oil wells to predict the profitability and risk of loss of developing new wells in each region, in order to choose the best region for wells development, and provide a model to choose top 200 wells from 500 wells samples. 

# Libraries
*pandas, numpy, sklearn*
