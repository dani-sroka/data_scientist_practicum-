# Data Scientist Program Projects at Practicum

This repo includes Data Science projects that I completed as part of the Data Science program in Practicum by Yandex.
They involve Data Preprocessing, Analysis and Visualization, Statistical Analysis, Machine Learning, Machine Learning for texts, Time Series, Computer Vision, etc.
